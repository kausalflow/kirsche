# Documentation for Kirsche

Kirsche, connecting your papers.

> Kirsche is cherry in German.


## Install

```
pip install kirsche
```

This will leave out many dependencies. To install kirsche together with all the requirements,

```
pip install "kirsche[all]"
```

The extras options:

- `all`: everything
- `docs`: required to build the docs

## The Idea

By providing a list of papers, Kirsche connects them.
